# Print out the third letter in this variable:

tester = "PrintTheThirdLetter"
print() # <--- Put your answer in this print statement

# Sort this list alphabetically and then print it:

sortMe = ["Suna", "Freya", "Yuki", "Ichiro", "Ys", "Dogfart"]
print()

# Create a new file called big_dickheads.txt



# Write the above list to big_dickheads.txt



# Add the date to big_dickheads.txt WITHOUT overwriting the list already in there



# Create a function that adds together 1 to X, X being the argument for the function
# For example, function_name(5) would return "15", because 1+2+3+4+5 = 15
# function_name(3) would return 6, because 1+2+3 = 6



# Create a function that takes 2 int arguments and returns 'true' if the first 
# number can be divided by the second number, and false otherwise. 
# eg. funcction_name(12, 6) returns true. funcction_name(12, 7) returns false. 
# As a tip, google 'python modulo operator'



# Go to xiv_api.py, and see if you can get it to print JUST the slogan from the 
# get_fc_data function. For a second test, get it to print just the FC members 
# in alphabetical order from the get_fc_members function
# You WILL need to run `pip install requests` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
